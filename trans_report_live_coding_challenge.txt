# TransReport Live Coding Challenge

## Railway Incident Management

You are tasked with creating a dashboard for viewing railway incident metrics.

# Input

A CSV file of railway incidents in the following format:

1. Railway company name
2. Train number
3. Wagon number
4. Defect ID
5. Incident Date, format: `yyyy-mm-dd`
6. Incident Time: format: `hh-mm`

Defect IDs:

12: Filthy seat
42: Unknown Category
76: Broken window
112: Door not working
420: Lights not working

Input Sample:

```
Great Western Railway,2332,5,12,2022-02-07,11:45
Heathrow Express,19D3,6,42,2022-03-02,7:00
Heathrow Express,19D3,6,42,2022-03-02,8:00
Heathrow Express,19D3,6,42,2022-03-02,9:00
ScotRail,AA1D,12,42,2022-01-06,11:45
Stansted Express,1222R,A,76,2022-01-09,11:45
Thameslink,FP11S,8,420,2022-01-03,11:45
Great Western Railway,1172,8,112,2022-02-07,15:22
Thameslink,FP112,1,112,2022-01-21,17:50
```

> NOTE: you don't necessarily need to read this from a file, you can have it as a string.

# Output

Please display to standard output the following metrics:

1. The total number of incidents for each railway company
2. The number of incidents reported in January
3. Which train had the largest number of incidents
4. The days and hours when a `Unknown Category` incident happened
5. Given today's date is `2022-03-27`, list the incidents that occurred in the current month.

# Bonus Excersises

1. Write tests for the code that you've developed.
2. Think about a higher scale metric data pipeline that has to display the same information
in real time and explain how you would approach building such a system.
