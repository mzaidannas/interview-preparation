# Given a list servers. Their processing power is given as an array of integers, and boot power as an array of integers.
# Write a function to return the max length of sub array which's power consumption is less than or equal to max power limit.
# Formula to calculate the power consumption for a subArray is:
# Max(booting_power[i...j]) + Sum(processing_power[i....j]) * length of subArray.

# NOTE: Single server is also a subArray, return 0 if no such subArray can be found.

# @param processing_power {Array<Integer>} List of processing power of processors
# @param booting_power {Array<Integer>} List of booting power of processors
# @param max_power {Integer} Maximum power limit we can afford
# @return {Integer} Maximum processors that falls into max_power limit
